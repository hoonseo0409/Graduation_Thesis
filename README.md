Code FDM2.py is faster than FDM1.py, but FDM1 is more unstable when varable 'distance' is small. 
This program made as the Python 2.7 language.
How to use:
1. Enter the appropriate Distance(1~the number of pixels in width or height) and Error Limit(0~1.0 float) values.
2. In the 'Electron Input and FDM Potential' window, create a charge by left-clicking or right-dragging and dropping.
3. Start the operation by pressing the wheel button in the middle of the mouse.
4. Wait for all operations to finish (intermediate results will appear in the console window)
5. When you move the mouse after all the calculations are completed, the potential value at that position is displayed in console window.
