Approximate Solution of Poisson Equation Obtained by Finite Difference Method
Made by Seo Hoon (Kyung Hee University, hhoon0001@naver.com)
Code FDM2.txt is faster than FDM1.txt, but FDM1 is more unstable. 
This program made as the Python 2.7 language.
How to use:
1. Enter the appropriate Distance and Error Limit values.
2. In the 'Electron Input and FDM Potential' window, create a charge by left-clicking or right-dragging and dropping.
3. Start the operation by pressing the wheel button in the middle of the mouse.
4. Wait for all operations to finish (intermediate results will appear in the console window)
5. When you move the mouse after all the calculations are completed, the potential value at that position is displayed in console window.
